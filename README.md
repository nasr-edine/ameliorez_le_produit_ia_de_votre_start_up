# Improving the AI Product of Your Startup

## Introduction
Welcome to the project "Improving the AI Product of Your Startup." In this project, you are an AI Engineer working for the startup "Avis Restau," which connects customers with restaurants. Your company aims to enhance its platform by introducing a new collaboration feature, allowing users to post reviews and photos of their favorite restaurants. Additionally, the company wants to gain better insights into the user-posted reviews.

## Problem Statement and Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study for two specific functionalities: detecting dissatisfaction topics in user comments and automatically labeling the photos posted on the platform. To achieve this, you need to analyze existing data and collect new data to train your AI models.

## Overview of the Dataset
The problem statement highlights that there is insufficient data available on the Avis Restau platform. Therefore, the solution is to utilize an existing dataset. The recommended dataset for this project is the Yelp dataset, which contains general information about restaurants, including consumer reviews. You can access the dataset through the following link: [https://www.yelp.com/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)

## Data Collection
As part of the project, you also need to address the issue of collecting new data. To achieve this, the solution proposed is to collect data through the Yelp API. The feasibility of this approach will be validated by collecting information for approximately 200 restaurants in a specific city using the API. You can refer to the Yelp API documentation for more details on how to collect the data.

## Tools
The project will be implemented using Python along with specialized NLP (Natural Language Processing) and CV (Computer Vision) libraries. Jupyter Notebook and the Voilà package will be utilized for development and creating an interactive web page for visualizations.

By following the outlined steps and methodologies, you aim to analyze negative comments to detect various dissatisfaction topics, process and reduce the dimensionality of textual data, analyze photos to identify their categories, and validate the feasibility of subsequent supervised classification. The collected data will be stored in a usable format, and your work will be presented through a self-explanatory Jupyter Notebook, a web page with graphical representations using the Voilà package, and a support material for the oral presentation.
